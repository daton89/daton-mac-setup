## Do you have a good pc but you are tired to use linux?

In the early 2014 I bought an HP Envy in the 2014, after my degree, i had the necessity of work on a couple of project  and my old white MacBook late 2007 was very slow to develop. I found a big deal and i bought this laptop to use it in my next project.

Off course, the first thing i did was install Ubuntu and remove Windows 8 on this laptop to make the setup environment easier. But the experience with Ubuntu was not so nice so i switched to Fedora. It is the most beautiful Linux distribution i've ever had. 

In the meanwhile i was thinking about the building of a CustomMac Pro since i found this incredible product [https://www.tonymacx86.com/](https://www.tonymacx86.com/). In the late 2012 it was very difficult to figure out how to make it work but after a couple of weeks it was done! I've used this Custom Mac Pro to work on a lot of things, so in the last weeks i was thinking about buying a new MacBook Pro, but my Envy is still a powerful computer and would be wasted if i bought a new Mac. 

Reading the blog of [https://www.tonymacx86.com/](https://www.tonymacx86.com/) i found a lot of upgrade that they did after the last time i've used it. This community is very nice and they did a lot of work to make the installing of a Mac OS really easy on your Laptop or PC. 

## Do you have a chance to make your computer a Mac?

Yes, after some attempts, in a couple of days, i finally have my Envy running Mac OS High Sierra. Basically all the Intel pc can use it thanks to the bootloader they build  and all the tools that they made to make it work well.
