# Codeanywhere

## Getting start with a React application

{% hint style="info" %}
 Since there is no container yet for a React application we start creating a new container running on codeanywhere.com
{% endhint %}

* Start a blank container. I used ubuntu 14.04 based blank container.
* Install node and npm 

```bash
// install nodejs and npm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm 
```
