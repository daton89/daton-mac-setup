# Docker Desktop for Mac

We can use a Minikube using the Kubernetes service available in Docker Desktop. 

To do that just go to settings and enable Kubernetes service.

### Lifecycles of minikube

```bash
minikube start
minikube stop
```

### Delete minikube

```bash
minikube delete
rm -rf ~/.minikube
```
