# Keyboard Mapping

## How to change the some button on the keyboard

The mapping for Control, Option, and Command are according to the physical layout of the keys on an actual MacBook keyboard, not the labels on the keys. Control=Control, Windows=Option, and Alt=Command. If you want a more PC friendly keyboard layout, use `Karabiner` \(formerly KeyRemap4MacBook\). You can find it [here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/).  
  
Brightness up/down are implemented with DSDT patches and my VoodooPS2Controller. Mirror Toggle is also implemented. Since I don't have the laptop, I forget the physical keys used.  
  
The function of Fn+F1..F12 and F1..F12 can be changed in SysPrefs-&gt;Keyboard.
