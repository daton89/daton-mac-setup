# Sentry

If you build Web Application, you probably use Sentry. We are going to setup a self-hosted instance of Sentry running Docker.

## Installation of Sentry On Premise 

Clone of fork Sentry On Premise: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise.git ~/Projects/SentryOnPremise
```

There may need to be modifications to the included `docker-compose.yml` file to accommodate your needs or your environment. These instructions are a guideline for what you should generally do.

1. `mkdir -p data/{sentry,postgres}` - Make our local database and sentry config directories. This directory is bind-mounted with postgres so you don't lose state!
2. `docker-compose run --rm web config generate-secret-key` - Generate a secret key. Add it to `docker-compose.yml` in `base` as `SENTRY_SECRET_KEY`.
3. `docker-compose run --rm web upgrade` - Build the database. Use the interactive prompts to create a user account.
4. `docker-compose up -d` - Lift all services \(detached/background mode\).
5. Access your instance at `localhost:9000`!

Note that as long as you have your database bind-mounted, you should be fine stopping and removing the containers without worry.
