# VS Code

## Installation

You can get `Visual Studio Code` from his [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once downloaded, drag and drop the application file into your **Applications** folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
Instead of downloading and installing `VSCode` manually, you can use `Homebrew` `brew cask install visual-studio-code`
{% endhint %}
