## Homebrew {#homebrew}

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) calls itself _The missing package manager for macOS_ and is an essential tool for any developer.

### Installation {#installation}

An important dependency before Homebrew can run is the **Command Line Tools** for **Xcode**. These include compilers that will allow you to build things from source, if you are missing this it's available through the App Store &gt; Updates.

To install Homebrew paste the following command \(without the `$`\) in your terminal, hit **Enter**, and follow the steps on the screen:

```text
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

One thing we need to do is tell the system to use programs installed by Hombrew \(in `/usr/local/bin`\) rather than the OS default if it exists. We do this by adding `/usr/local/bin` to your `$PATH`environment variable \(if you're using oh my zsh you should use `.zshrc` instead of `.bash_profile`\):

```text
$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Alternatively, we can also insert `/usr/local/bin` to the first line of `/private/etc/paths` and reboot the Mac to change global paths loading order. Admin password may be required if you modify the file.

To be able to use `brew` you need to start a new terminal session. Do this by opening a new terminal tab with **Cmd+T** \(you should also close the old one\), then run the following command to make sure everything is working:

```text
$ brew doctor
```
